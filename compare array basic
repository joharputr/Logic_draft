Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].

If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.

void main() {
  String alice = "";
  String bob = "";
  
  List<int> pointAlice = [1,2,3];
  List<int> pointBob = [4,5,0];
  
  for(int i = 0; i<pointAlice.length; i++){
    print(i);
     for(int j = 0; j<pointBob.length; j++){
       if(j == i){
           if(pointAlice[i] > pointBob[j]){
        print("AliceWin");
      }else if(pointAlice[i] < pointBob[j]){
        print("BobWin");
      }
       }
    
    }
  }
